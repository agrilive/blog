## Hello, I'm Wei Ching :blush:

A highly motivated individual, who self-learnt machine learning, and just completed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) internship. Coming from a Social Science background, I aspire to be an AI Engineer who builds impactful and scalable solutions for global problems. Two causes that I fervently believe in are poverty :rocket: and women empowerment :woman:.

### Empowering people

I am inspired by the works of Bill and Melinda Gates at their foundation. They have tackled several of the world's most pertinent problems, including healthcare and sanitation. I too, desire to make an impact on people's lives by empowering them. I hope that disadvantaged communities become stronger and lead the lives they desire.

### Reach out to me

I am open to collaboration related to computer vision and social impact work. You can contact me via email to cherie.ong.wc@gmail.com.
